Project Architecture / Project Flow

1. Data Cleaning Phase- Feature Selection, Conversion Into Dummies

2. Dimensionality Reduction Which Method & Why?

3. Algorithms- Multiple Algorithms Used & Their Accuracies

4. Train & Test Splitting  : Sampling Methods for Imbalanced Data

5. Meta Algorithms & Neural Networks- Multiple Meta Algorithms & NN Used & Their Accuracies

6. Cross Validation & Hyper parameter Tuning- Which Method & Why?

7. Deployment Phase 

The dataset is having incidents raised by customers. Which contains an event log of an incident management process extracted from a service desk platform of an IT company.

Dataset contains total 26 features, and 1.4Lac+ records. Out of which 25 features are independent and 'Impact' Feature is output variable.

The Prediction needs to be Classified into 3 Classes:

High Impact
Medium Impact
Low Impact

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


This Phase Includes EDA part for Project Conducted in Tableau.

Each Categorical and Numerical variable is Visualised in Tableau session. Please find Tableau workbook Here

Each Feature is interacting with each other, making whole workbook fully interactive. Please find the detailed workbook here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ashish.gore#!/vizhome/Impact_predictionProjectStories/Story2

Fully Interactive Dashboards were created for both Numerical as well as Categorical Features.

After Analysis of EDA part, the data had some hidden Insights, which are mentioned using stories:
